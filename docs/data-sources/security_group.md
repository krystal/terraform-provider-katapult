# katapult_security_group (Data Source)

Fetch details for a individual security group, including all rules.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get security group by ID with rules.
data "katapult_security_group" "web" {
  id = "sg_O3NQJHXsgan6vO1V"
}

# Get security group by ID without rules.
data "katapult_security_group" "web-plain" {
  id            = "sg_O3NQJHXsgan6vO1V"
  include_rules = false

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

### Optional

- `include_rules` (Boolean) Whether to include rules in the output. Defaults to `true`.

### Read-Only

- `allow_all_inbound` (Boolean) Whether or not to allow all inbound traffic. If not explicitly set, it defaults to false, blocking all inbound traffic not covered by a inbound rule. If changed to true on a existing security group, all existing inbound rules will be deleted, hence it cannot be enabled while any inbound rules are defined.
- `allow_all_outbound` (Boolean) Whether or not to allow all outbound traffic. If not explicitly set, it defaults to false, blocking all outbound traffic not covered by a outbound rule. If changed to true on a existing security group, all existing outbound rules will be deleted, hence it cannot be enabled while any outbound rules are defined.
- `associations` (Set of String) The resource IDs to apply this security group to. Accepts IDs of virtual machines, virtual machine groups, and tags.
- `inbound_rules` (List of Object) Zero or more inbound rules to apply to the security group. Each rule specifies inbound traffic which should be allowed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--inbound_rules))
- `name` (String) The name of the security group.
- `outbound_rules` (List of Object) Zero or more outbound rules to apply to the security group. Each rule specifies outbound traffic which should be allowed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--outbound_rules))
